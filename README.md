## Self Hosted Agents on Kubernetes   

Are you tired of wrestling with manual agent management, lengthy pipeline queues, or soaring infrastructure costs in your Azure DevOps setup? Look no further! In this comprehensive series of guides, weâ€™ll explore how leveraging Kubernetes for self-hosted agents can revolutionize your CI/CD processes. Say goodbye to operational headaches and hello to streamlined, efficient pipelines.  
If you find yourself grappling with the management of Azure DevOps self-hosted agents or experiencing prolonged wait times in pipeline queues, or perhaps facing higher costs associated with agent infrastructure, or struggling with the setup and maintenance of self-hosted agent environments, then Kubernetes presents an optimal solution to address these challenges.  
Furthermore, the absence of Kubernetes orchestration complicates the setup of diverse environments for running pipelines on self-hosted agents. Organizations may struggle to configure and manage different agent environments for testing, staging, and production, resulting in inconsistency and potential deployment issues. Additionally, without the scalability and elasticity provided by Kubernetes, organizations may experience bottlenecks and delays due to long queue times in Azure DevOps pipelines, leading to decreased productivity and slower time-to-market.  
In summary, without leveraging Kubernetes for Azure DevOps self-hosted agents, organizations may face a myriad of challenges including operational inefficiencies, pipeline delays, increased costs, and complexity in environment management. Embracing Kubernetes as a solution offers scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and streamlined operations, enabling organizations to optimize their CI/CD workflows and accelerate software delivery.
